# gdp_and_co2_decoupling

This project aims to analyze the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth, with a focus on identifying countries that have successfully "decoupled" or on the path of decoupling their CO2 emissions from their GDP growth.

The project uses data on CO2 emissions and GDP per capita for 184 countries. It applies various statistical and graphical methods to analyze the relationship between the two variables. The main results of the analysis are presented in the form of scatter plots, trend lines, and regression coefficients. Additionally, the project identifies countries that have achieved a "decoupling" of their CO2 emissions and GDP growth, meaning that they have been able to sustain economic growth without a corresponding increase in CO2 emissions.
